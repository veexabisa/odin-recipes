    <h4>
      If you’ve never made homemade Caesar Salad with Grilled Chicken before,
      this is the recipe to try.
    </h4>
    <p>
      Caesar salad was created by Italian immigrant and restaurateur, Caesar
      Cardini, who whipped up this creation in his restaurant in 1924 Tijuana,
      Mexico. In the 70’s, it found its way to New York City, served in the
      fancier steakhouses of that time, and ever since has been in menus across
      America.

      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese plus extra for topping</li>
      <li>
        3 garlic cloves smashed and dressed with a little olive oil and salt
      </li>
      <li>
        1 tbsp anchovy paste or 3 anchovy fillets plus more if you want to
        garnish the top of the salad
      </li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice about 2 lemons</li>
      <li>2 tbsp water</li>
      <li>squirt of Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 loaf baguette</li>
      <li>2 tsp garlic salt</li>
      <li>3 grilled chicken breasts</li>
      <li>3 heads of romaine lettuce washed and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
      <li>
        Make salad dressing. In a food processor or blender, mix together 1/2
        cup olive oil, garlic cloves, anchovy past, egg yolk, Dijon mustard,
        lemon juice, water, and Worcestershire sauce. When blended, add in
        Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to taste and blend again. Set aside in
        the fridge for at least an hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut up the baguette into large, bite-sized chunks. In a large casserole
        dish, mix together 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and the
        garlic salt. Add more oil and salt as needed. Bake for about 20 minutes.
        Adjust time (bake longer) if you want the croutons crunchier.
      </li>
      <li>Grill the chicken. Let it cool and then slice on the diagonal.</li>
      <li>Assemble all ingredients and serve.</li>
    </ol>
