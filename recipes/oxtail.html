      <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>400 g carrots, sliced julienne</li>
      <li>400 g celery, sliced julienne</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh rosemary finely chopped, plus an additional sprig</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh thyme finely chopped,</li>
      <li>4 leaves dried bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 cloves</li>
      <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
      <li>2 cans whole tomatoes cans</li>
      <li>1 cup red wine</li>
      <li>1 litre beef stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven 220°C. Place 3 T oil in a roasting tray and heat in the
        oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is hot, add the oxtail and toss until all the meat is
        coated. Season to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the meat to the oven and cook for a further 20 minutes, or until
        it’s nicely browned and the fat is golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place the carrots, celery and herbs in a large saucepan with
        the remaining olive oil and gently simmer for 20 minutes. (You may need
        to add a few tablespoons of water at some point.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the oxtail from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven’s
        temperature to 170°C.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the bay leaves, cloves, flour, tomatoes, wine and beef stock to the
        vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly add the oxtail, all the roasting juices and bring to a boil.
        Return to the roasting tray, cover with a lid and cook in the oven for a
        further 5 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you make this a day or two in advance, no harm comes to it if you put
        it into the oven at 170°C for another hour or so to heat it up.
      </li>
